# Data Engineering Projects

Welcome to my Data Engineering Projects repository! This space hosts some projects related to data engineering, each developed to address specific challenges and enhance data processing capabilities.

## Projects
- **Project 1: Redshift Catalog**
  - This project aims to provide visibility into the system catalog tables generated by Redshift. The use of these tables has played a crucial role in cataloging, monitoring, and governing our data warehouse. As detailed in the article linked to the project, the process of ingesting these tables may pose some challenges, and I hope that the provided code proves helpful.
  **Data Stack:** DBT, Redshift.
